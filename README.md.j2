## BioAnalyze Docker Images

These docker images are built to use as a part of a full stack Bioinformatics Analysis Environment. Each image can be used on it's own or as a part of a Jupyterhub Cluster.

Each image is meant to be a full fledged ecosystem for Bioinformatics. Images:

* Are fully ready to use with a [Jupyterhub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Dask Gateway Cluster](https://gateway.dask.org/install-kube.html).
* RStudio installed
* Jupyterlab installed
* Common software packages for data science such as Pandas, SciKit Learn, and TidyVerse
* Bioinformatics workflow runners: [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).
* Workflow Orchestration systems: [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/#basic-installation) and [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/local.html).
* Use the excellent [Pangeo Project](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images) as a base.
* Documentation packages such as [Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/) and [RBookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

## Dask-gateway compatibility

(This information is completely grabbed from [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images#dask-gateway-compatibility))

If deploying in a Jupyterhub on Kubernetes cluster you'll need to make sure you're using the same pangeo versions.
